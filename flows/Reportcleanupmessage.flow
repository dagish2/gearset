            <fieldText>Hi {user.firstname},

This week&apos;s release includes bug fixes and performance improvements. In addition, this release contains a change to the Primary Member field on Opportunities. 

Primary Member Opportunity Field - Changes

There were previously two &quot;Primary Member&quot; fields in Salesforce. One was on the Opportunity object and the other on the Account object.

The Account &quot;Primary Member&quot; field is what determines who Spacestation sends paperwork to. The &quot;Primary Member&quot; field on Opportunities has no impact in determining who should sign paperwork. 

To prevent confusion over these two identically named fields, we are renaming the Opportunity &quot;Primary Member&quot; field to &quot;Key Contact&quot; instead. 

The &quot;Primary Member&quot; field on Opportunities will be renamed to &quot;Key Contact&quot; 
The &quot;Primary Member&quot; field on Accounts will remain unchanged 
Paperwork is sent to Account &quot;Primary Member&quot;
Opportunity &quot;Key Contact&quot; is a decision maker on the deal but may or may not be the Primary Member / Paperwork Signatory

Sincerely,
Susie</fieldText>
