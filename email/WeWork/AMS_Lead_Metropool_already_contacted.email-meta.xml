    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.Salutation_Name__c},


I wanted to follow up on our previous email and see if you&apos;re interested in stopping by WeWork for a tour of our Metropool location.

I&apos;d love to learn more about your company and show you around as space is filling up quickly!




Are you available for a tour this week or next?
As always, you can also check our Metropool page and book a tour online if more convenient for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
