    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

Happy New Year!
This week&apos;s release includes bug fixes and performance improvements. In addition, this release contains a enhancement to the manage tour feature.

Manage Tour feature - New UI

When navigating to the manage/book a tour on top of the journey or opportunity record, the first change you will encounter is the account selector is now available before the tour booking feature.

For a refresher on the Account selector, please click the links below.

Once on the manage/ book a tour feature, you will notice the &quot;Profile information&quot; is now a required section.

If the Profile information section is greyed out, please fill in this information on the account records.

Continuing to &quot;book tours&quot; section, you will notice that &quot;Tour by sales lead&quot; field is now available for all users.

This feature allows users 3 important abilities once selecting the &quot;Yes&quot; option
1. The tour will be assigned to you.
2. The opportunity will be assigned to you
3. The Account will be assigned to you (if it is a Consumer Account)

Note, if you are not hosting the tour or don&apos;t wish to manage this account, please select &quot;No&quot;
Note, Training video will be available early next week.





Email notification for Consumer sales lead.

If you are a consumer sales lead you will receive an email alert for every tour scheduled in their cluster.

As always if you  have any questions or concerns, please contact us at salesforcesupport@wework.com

Warmly,
