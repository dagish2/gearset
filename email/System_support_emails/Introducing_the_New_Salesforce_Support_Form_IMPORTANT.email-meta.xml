    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},



As our Salesforce user base continues to grow, we are excited to launch a new Salesforce Support submission process.



All support questions should be directed to Salesforce Support via this form.

This form will allow us to better capture your questions from the get-go which enables us to:



Route your question to the right person/team

Minimize back and forth troubleshooting

Get you a better response faster




Beginning {!Today()+1}, all users who submit requests to salesforcesupport@wework.com will receive an automated message directing them to our new form.



Thanks,

The Salesforce Support Team</textOnly>
