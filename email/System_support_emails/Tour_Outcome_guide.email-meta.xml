Account Selector
New Feature
The objective of the Account Selector page is to prevent the creation of duplicate Accounts by identifying and merging into existing records. The Account Selector page appears when converting a Lead into an Account/Contact/Opportunity. The page contains a list of existing accounts that are possible matches for the new record to be merged into.
