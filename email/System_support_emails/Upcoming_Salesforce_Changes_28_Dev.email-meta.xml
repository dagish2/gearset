    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

This week&apos;s release contains changes to Opportunity management and Tour Booking.

Managing Products

We&apos;ve modified the &quot;Manage Products&quot; and &quot;Split Opportunity&quot; pages within Opportunities for improved clarity. 

Now, users may designate an added product as a &quot;Primary Product&quot;. For multi-product Opportunities, the product line item marked as the &quot;Primary Product&quot; will determine which Building/Nearest Building and Geography that the Opportunity inherits.


Updated Opportunity Names


Opportunity Names will update based on the products associated with it to provide additional clarity.

Opportunity names will show the Account - Product Classification -City/Building (if appropriate) -  Close Date
