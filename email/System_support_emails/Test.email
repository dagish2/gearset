Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName}, 

As a part of Salesforce's Summer 2018 release, there is a new Report Builder available utilizing their Lightning experience. 

If you'd like to create a new report using the Classic view of Report Builder, click the 'New Report (Salesforce Classic)' button under the Reports tab. 



If you'd like to modify an existing report using the Classic view of Report Builder, click the arrow next to the 'Edit' button the top right and select 'Edit (Salesforce Classic)'. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at salesforcesupport@wework.com 

Sincerely, 
Shani
