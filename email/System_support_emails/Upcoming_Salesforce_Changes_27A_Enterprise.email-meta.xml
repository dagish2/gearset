    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},



This week&apos;s release contains changes to Opportunity management and Tour Booking.


Managing Products


We&apos;ve modified the &quot;Manage Products&quot; and &quot;Split Opportunity&quot; pages within Opportunities for improved clarity.


Now, users may designate an added product as a &quot;Primary Product&quot;.



For multi-product Opportunities, the product line item marked as the &quot;Primary Product&quot; determine which Building/Nearest Building and Geography that the Opportunity has and which product line items that can be split.





Updated Opportunity Names


Opportunity Names will update based on the products associated with it to provide additional clarity.





Rescheduling a Tour updates the &quot;Booked by&quot; Assignment Field


Pre-populating Line Items when Booking Multiple Tours</textOnly>
