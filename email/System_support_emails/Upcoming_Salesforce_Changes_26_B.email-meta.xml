    <subject>IMPORTANT PLEASE READ: New Feature Updates</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

This week&apos;s release contains changes to Opportunities and Campaign assignment logic

Commitment terms
We&apos;ve renamed the &quot;Member Success&quot; section on the Opportunity as &quot;Sales Details&quot; for improved clarity.
This section contains a series of now required fields detailing inventory use case and projected move out details

Additionally, as an Opportunity may contain multiple reservables, you will now see a field labeled &quot;Weighted Avg Commitment Term (in months)&quot; which is the average of your Opportunityâ€™s commitments in months.
Once an agreement is signed, commitment term and discount details are visible via related lists on the Opportunity

Reservable Hold Feature
Select the &quot;Reservable Hold&quot; button on an Opportunity
Then fill in the form and click Save.
You will receive an email notification about your hold as well as updates at various benchmarks.

Additionally, a hold can be released by clicking the &quot;Release Hold&quot; button on the hold record
The holds for an Opportunity are viewable via a related list

Billing Account Selector Update
The Billing Account Selector page has been updated to include all Billing/Blank Accounts under an Organization in its results.

Campaign Assignment logic
Lead/journey assignment can now be managed from campaigns
To ensure that related journeys are routed correctly please ensure that the fields below are filled in when creating a Campaign

Additional Notes:

Lead Owner requires a user or Queue ID
Email Address requires your building&apos;s email address
City and State requires the same value on the building record

If you have any questions, please contact us at salesforcesupport@wework.com

Warmly,
