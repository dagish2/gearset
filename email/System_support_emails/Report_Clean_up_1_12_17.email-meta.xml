    <subject>PLEASE READ: Deleting Salesforce reports and dashboards</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},
On February 5, 2017, we will be deleting all reports and dashboards not used in the last 30 days. This included reports and dashboards in your personal folders.

If you have a report or dashboard you would like to keep, please refresh or run it within the next 2 weeks. This will keep the report from being deleted. Scheduled reports and dashboards will NOT be impacted by this update.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at salesforcesupport@wework.com
Warmly,
Susie</textOnly>
