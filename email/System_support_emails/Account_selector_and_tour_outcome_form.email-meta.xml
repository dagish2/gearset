Account Selector
What is the Account Selector Page?

The Account Selector page is a page in Salesforce that appears when converting a Lead into an Account/Contact/Opportunity. The page contains a list of existing accounts that are possible matches for the new record to be merged into.

The objective of the Account Selector page is to prevent the creation of duplicate Accounts by identifying and merging into existing records.
