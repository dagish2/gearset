    <subject>PLEASE READ: Changes to salesforce Opportunities</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

This week&apos;s release includes bug fixes and performance improvements. In addition, this release contains a change to the Primary Member field on Opportunities.

Primary Member Opportunity Field - Changes

There were previously two &quot;Primary Member&quot; fields in Salesforce. One was on the Opportunity and the other on the Account.

The Account &quot;Primary Member&quot; field is what determines who Spacestation sends paperwork to. The &quot;Primary Member&quot; field on Opportunities has no impact in determining who should sign paperwork.

To prevent confusion over these two identically named fields, we are renaming the Opportunity &quot;Primary Member&quot; field to &quot;Key Contact&quot; instead.

The &quot;Primary Member&quot; field on Opportunities will be renamed to &quot;Key Contact&quot;
The &quot;Primary Member&quot; field on Accounts will remain unchanged
Paperwork is sent to Account &quot;Primary Member&quot;
Opportunity &quot;Key Contact&quot; is a decision maker on the deal but may or may not be the Primary Member / Paperwork Signatory


Sincerely,
