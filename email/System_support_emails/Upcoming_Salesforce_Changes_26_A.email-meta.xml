    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

This week&apos;s release contains the new account hierarchy structure.

What is Account Hierarchy?
Account hierarchy is the linking of an account to another account. Creating this relationship helps sales reps manage accounts.
We have created 3 account types. Billing accounts, Sales accounts and Organization accounts.
