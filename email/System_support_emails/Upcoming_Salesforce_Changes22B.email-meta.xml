    <subject>PLEASE READ: Changes Account selector and Account / Opportunity</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

This week&apos;s release includes bug fixes and performance improvements. In addition, this release contains an enhancement to our Account Selector Page and Account  / Opportunity Record Types.

Account Selector Page - Create Account Buttons

There has been a new button added to the Account Selector Page labeled &quot;Create Account and Don&apos;t Merge&quot;
This button allows NMD users to bypass the Account Auto Merge logic after the record has been created
For non-NMD users this logic is disabled and the buttons are identical in function. Either button can used to bypass the Account Selector Page and create a new Account

Account / Opportunity Record Type Changes (Sales Reps Only)

Sales users will no longer be prompted with a selection page to select a Record Type when creating a new Account or Opportunity
Instead, the Account or Opportunity Record Type will automatically update to the proper segment based on the &quot;Number of Full-Time Employees&quot; field value entered by the user (or based on the Unomy full-time employee count if the FTE field is left blank)



If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at salesforcesupport@wework.com

Yours Truly,
Susie Romero</textOnly>
