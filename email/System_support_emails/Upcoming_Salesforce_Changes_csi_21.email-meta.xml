    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

This week&apos;s release contains a change to our paperwork process and tour booking features.

Resend Paperwork
You can now resend a contract from Salesforce. On the opportunity, you will find a button &quot;Resend Paperwork&quot; in the upper right corner.

This feature is only available when the opportunity stage is &quot;Closing&quot; and the Contract stage is &quot;Contract Voided

New Referral Information fields the on Tour Outcome and Manage/ Book a tour features
We&apos;ve Added 2 new fields “Referrer Name” and “Referrer Email” on the pages for Tour Booking and Tour Outcome to capture the Referrer data. This information is not required.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at salesforcesupport@wework.com

Sincerely
Tykira</textOnly>
