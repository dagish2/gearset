    <textOnly>Hi {!Receiving_User.FirstName},

This week&apos;s release includes updates to Account segmentation, Closed Lost reasons and the Import Journey tool.


Account Segmentation

The medium Account Segment has been redefined from 20 to 249 full time employees to 10 to 249 full time employees.

All newly generated Leads or Accounts with 10 - 19 full time employees will be designated as the &quot;Mid-Market&quot; record type and medium segment.


Closed Lost Reasons

Help text has been added to provide additional context when selecting a Lost Reason while closing out an Opportunity as Closed Lost.

To view the help text:

1. Select a lost reason

2. Hover over the blue &apos;i&apos; icon


Import Journey Tool

The Import Journey tool has been updated to prevent row lock errors when uploading large numbers of leads/journeys.

To access the Import Journey tool, click the + sign on the top right of the Salesforce window and click Import Journeys.

Instructions on how to use the Import Journey Tool can be found on this Connect page: https://connect.we.co/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=140644887

For any questions or concerns please contact Salesforce support via our Support Ticket page or reach out to your local Growth Operations team.


Thanks,
Salesforce Team</textOnly>
