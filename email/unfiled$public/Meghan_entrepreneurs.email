Hi {!Lead.Salutation_Name__c},

I am on the Community team at WeWork! I heard that you met with my colleagues Josh and Johnny at eMerge America! I heard great things about the conference and the connections that they've made! 

We would love to invite you to visit our space at WeWork Lincoln Road. It'd be great to meet up again, explore our membership options, and how you could fit into our community. 

Looking forward to hearing from you! 

Best, 

Meghan
