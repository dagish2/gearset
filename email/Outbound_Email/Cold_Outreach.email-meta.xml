    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I came across your company on LinkedIn and would love to hear more about what your team is doing. I&apos;d also like to personally invite you to our EVENT NAME + LINK this DAY, DATE and to come tour the new floors at our TARGET LOCATION + LINK location in CITY.

We would love to meet you and explore having you join our global community of creators. Please let me know what day/time works best for you or simply book a tour online [INSERT LINK].

Thanks, and have a great day!</textOnly>
