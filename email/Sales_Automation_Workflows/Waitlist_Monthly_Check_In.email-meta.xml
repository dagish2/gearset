    <textOnly>Hi there!

We know you are still waiting on the WeWork space, but unfortunatelly we don&apos;t have anything avaiable right now. We will contact you as soon as we get an opening.

Please confirm that you want to stay on the Waitlist for WeWork Buildings or select &quot;I&apos;m No Longer Interested&quot; so we will stop following up with you.
