Hi there!

We know you are still waiting on the WeWork space, but unfortunately we don&apos;t have anything available right now. We will contact you as soon as we get an opening.

Please confirm that you want to stay on the Waitlist for WeWork Buildings or select &quot;I&apos;m No Longer Interested&quot; so we will stop following up with you.

Waitlist Check-In:https://welcome.wework.com/forms/waitlistconfirmation.php?oppId={!Opportunity.Id}

No longer interested: https://welcome.wework.com/forms/notinterested.php?oppId={!Opportunity.Id}
