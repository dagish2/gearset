    <textOnly>Hi {!Tour_Outcome__c.Tour_With__c},

Thanks for your interest in WeWork, the platform for creators.

We&apos;re thrilled that you&apos;re thinking about becoming a member and look forward to showing you around.

You&apos;re all set for a tour on {!Tour_Outcome__c.Tour_Date__c} at {!Tour_Outcome__c.Start_Time__c}! While we&apos;re currently reserving desks for {!Tour_Outcome__c.Building_No_City__c}, this space is still being completed. In the meantime, please meet us at WeWork River North at 111 W Illinois Street.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to westloop@wework.com.

See you soon!

The WeWork Team
